hack.bs is a non-profit [cypherpunk]({{< ref "cypherpunks" >}}) hackerspace located in Brescia, Italy. Our mission is to provide a space where people can learn about Bitcoin, technology, open-source, privacy and freedom, and connect with other like-minded individuals.

{{< framed >}}

We are a space for hackers, designed by hackers.

Our office is near the metro stop Vittoria, in Contrada del Cavalletto 24, Brescia.

During the day we are a coworking space, while in the night and in the weekends we host
workshops, meetups, hackathons and more.

We are funded through voluntary contributions from individuals and private companies: if you want to support our project consider [making a donation]({{< ref "donate" >}}).
We have a [transparency]({{< ref "transparency" >}}) page to show exactly how we allocate our funds.

We have limited seats, and therefore, we've had to implement a waiting list. If you're interested in the coworking space please fill out [this form](https://forms.hack.bs.it/form/5V9yVl), and we'll get in touch with you as soon as possible!

## Events

We regularly organize events open to our members, including hackerspace nights, hackathons, film screenings, and meetups with presentations. You can find more information on our social media pages.
