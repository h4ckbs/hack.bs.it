hack.bs is a non-profit [cypherpunk]({{< ref "cypherpunks" >}}) hackerspace located in Brescia, Italy. Our mission is to provide a space where people can learn about Bitcoin, technology, open-source, privacy and freedom, and connect with other like-minded individuals.

{{< framed >}}

We are a space for hackers, designed by hackers.

Our office is near the metro stop Vittoria, in Contrada del Cavalletto 24, Brescia.

During the day we are a [coworking space]({{< ref "coworking" >}}]), while in the night and in the weekends we host [events]({{< ref "events" >}}]) such as
workshops, meetups, hackathons and more.

We are funded through voluntary contributions from individuals and private companies: if you want to support our project consider [making a donation]({{< ref "donate" >}}).
We have a [transparency]({{< ref "transparency" >}}) page to show exactly how we allocate our funds.

## Membership

Being a non-profit, we need to limit the access to our space to our members; becoming a member isn't difficult at all, though! The price is 10€/year, and you can register in person.
