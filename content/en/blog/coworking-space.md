We promised to send regular updates on the blog, and here we are, 7 months since the last post.

Don't hate us! :P

# The Coworking Space

Our coworking space is finally open to the public!

Let's be honest; we're not a luxury coworking space. The place is a bit spartan, but it's filled with friendly folks, and that's what really matters, right? :)

Our rates:

{{< framed >}}

Daily entrance: €15

5-day pass: €50

Monthly subscription: €120

Quarterly subscription: €300

Due to limited seats, we need to implement a waiting list. If you're interested in our coworking space, please register [here](https://forms.hack.bs.it/form/5V9yVl). We'll get in touch with you as soon as possible!

Please note that the coworking space is open to members only; the membership fee is €10 per year and can be obtained directly at our location.

# The Bar

"Bar" might be a bit of an overstatement - hack.bs has a red refrigerator filled with drinks. Hooray!

# The Bitcoin Shop

Our location hosts a small Bitcoin-focused shop where you can purchase:

- Official hack.bs T-shirts
- Official 'Il Priorato del Bitcoin' T-shirts
- Jade hardware wallet
- Coldcard hardware wallet (coming soon!)
- The book 'Villaggio Bitcoin: l'alba di una società nuova basata su una moneta sana e onesta'
- Stickers - some are free, and some are not :)

We have plans to expand the shop and eventually open an online store. Stay tuned!

# Events

In the past few months, we've organized various events, including:

Monthly meetup - once a month, a meetup with a presentation followed by dinner
Satoshi Spritz Brescia - an informal meetup for Bitcoin enthusiasts in Brescia
Hackerspace nights - once a week, members gather at our location to work on various projects related to the space

We plan to continue organizing these events and start film clubs (nights where we watch a movie all together and discuss it), hackathons (programming competitions), informal meetups, and much more!

# Even beautiful things come to an end...

...we've reached the end of the post :(
