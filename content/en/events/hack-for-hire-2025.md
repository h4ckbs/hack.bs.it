Join us for an exciting 24-hour coding marathon with a unique prize up for grabs: a job offer from [TwentyTwo Devices](https://twenty-two.xyz/) to work on their latest project!

## What

The goal of the hackathon is to build a multi-platform (Android, iOS) app using a technology of your choice (native, flutter, react native, kotlin MP, etc.).

More instructions will be given at the beginning of the event to ensure a level playing field, but you can expect to be given a topic for a very simple app, which you will then have to build (it will only take a few hours) and then expand with your own ideas.

No prior knowledge or experience with Bitcoin or hardware devices is required. Just mobile development skills are needed.

## Who can participate?

Anybody can participate, but you need to be over 18 years old. We don't care about credentials, age, or experience: we only care about your dedication and creativity. Students are welcome to join, but since the position will be full-time if you decide to accept you won't be able to keep attending classes.

Since we are looking for a single person, we won't accept teams but only individual participants.

## When

The hackathon will take place on **Saturday, March 22nd 2025** and **Sunday, March 23rd 2025**. The competition beings at 12:00 PM (noon) on Saturday and ends at 12:00 PM (noon) on Sunday. Afterwards you will be given two more hours to record a short (1-2 minutes) video showcasing your project, either with an emulator or a physical device.

## Where

The event will be held both in-person and online.

Note that we don’t have much space at the office, so please don't forget to mark the checkbox in the form if you plan to join in person and we will let you know if we still have capacity left (we apply a first-come first-served policy).

## Prize

As mentioned above, the prize is a job offer to work on the new Portal mobile app. We are looking for a full time dev to develop a cross-platform (Android and iOS) mobile app, who can be completely autonomous maintaining the project.

The RAL for this position is in the range **$40.000-$55.000/yr**, depending on the experience, talent, etc. **The offer will also include a portion of equity in our startup**.

The position will be **partially in-person and partially remote**: we plan to work from Brescia every Mon-Tue-Wed, then remotely Thu-Fri. We are also renting a hackerhouse in Brescia, so you will be able to stay there if you want, for free.

*Note: Since we are a US-based company we can only hire people in Italy as contractors under “partita iva”. If you don’t have it we can refer you to a really good accountant and cover all the costs to open it.*

## Rules

You will have to work by yourself, but using AI is allowed (even Cursor in agent mode).

We will ask you to work off of a remote filesystem (at least for your source code directory) so that we can monitor the evolution of the code over time. We will review the snapshots if we suspect you have not been working by yourself or if you’ve been heavily copying parts of other projects.

After reviewing the videos and the code, we will select the top 4-5 candidates and hold video calls with them, to get to know them better and ask questions about the project they’ve developed.

We will then offer the job to the person we think would be the best fit for our company. If they reject the offer we will keep going down the list until somebody accepts.

In the unlikely case that we cannot find a suitable developer, we will then offer a monetary prize of $1000, paid in BTC to the best project.
